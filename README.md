# TFG: diferencial-drive-robot

## Description

Welcome to the GitHub repository for our university project on building a Differential Drive Robot using the Robot Operating System (ROS). This project serves as an exploration of robotic systems, with a focus on designing, building, and controlling a mobile robot capable of differential drive motion.

## Project Goals

1. **Hardware Development**: I will detail the process of designing and building the physical robot platform, including the chassis, wheels, motors, sensors, and other essential components.

2. **ROS Integration**: Our goal is to integrate ROS into the robot's architecture. I will create ROS packages for controlling the robot, processing sensor data, and implementing various functionalities.

3. **Differential Drive Control**: I will implement the differential drive kinematics and control algorithms, allowing the robot to move and navigate effectively in both simulation and real-world environments.

4. **Sensor Fusion**: To enhance the robot's perception capabilities, I will explore sensor fusion techniques, combining data from sensors such as cameras, LiDAR, and IMUs to make informed decisions.

5. **Mapping and Localization**: I aim to implement mapping and localization algorithms, enabling the robot to create maps of its surroundings and accurately determine its position within these maps.

6. **Path Planning and Navigation**: I will develop path planning algorithms and navigation strategies to enable the robot to autonomously navigate through environments while avoiding obstacles.

7. **Simulation**: To facilitate testing and development, i will create simulation environments in Gazebo, allowing us to simulate the robot's behavior and test various algorithms before deploying them on the physical robot.

## Documentation

I will provide comprehensive documentation, including setup instructions, hardware schematics, ROS package descriptions, and tutorials to help others replicate and build upon our work.
